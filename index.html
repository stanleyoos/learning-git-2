        <br />
        City's breaking down on a camel's back.<br />
        They just have to go 'cause they don't know wack.<br />
        So while you fill the streets, it's appealing to see.<br />
        You won't get out the county 'cause you're damned and free.<br />
        <br />
        You've got a new horizon. It's ephemeral style.<br />
        A melancholy town where we never smile.<br />
        And all I wanna hear is the message beep.<br />
        My dreams, they've gotta kiss me<br />
        'Cause I don't get to sleep, no.<br />
        <br />
        Windmill, windmill for the land.<br />
        Turn forever hand in hand.<br />
        Take it all in on your stride.<br />
        It is ticking, falling down.<br />
        <br />
        Love forever. Love is free.<br />
        Let's turn forever, you and me.<br />
        Windmill, windmill for the land.<br />
        Is everybody in?<br />
        <br />
        Laughing gas these hazmats, fast cats.<br />
        Lining them up like ass cracks.<br />
        Lay these ponies at the track.<br />
        It's my chocolate attack.<br />
        <br />
        Shit, I'm stepping in hotter this year.<br />
        Care Bear reppin' it harder this year.<br />
        Watch me as I gravitate.<br />
        Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.<br />
        <br />
        Yo, we gon' ghost town,<br />
        This Motown.<br />
        With your sound<br />
        You're in the blink.<br />
        Gon' bite the dust.<br />
        Can't fight with us.<br />
        With your sound<br />
        You kill the Inc.<br />
        <br />
        So don't stop, get it, get it, get it<br />
        Until you're cheddar head.<br />
        And watch the way I navigate.<br />
        Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.<br />
        <br />
        Shake it, shake it, shake it, feel good.<br />
        Shake it, shake it, shake it, feel good.<br />
        Shake it, shake it, shake it, feel good.<br />
        Shake it, shake it, shake it, feel good.<br />
        <br />
        Windmill, windmill for the land.<br />
        Turn forever hand in hand.<br />
        Take it all in on your stride.<br />
        It is ticking, falling down.<br />
        <br />
        Love forever. Love is free.<br />
        Let's turn forever, you and me.<br />
        Windmill, windmill for the land.<br />
        Is everybody in?<br />
        <br />
        Don't stop, shit it, get it.<br />
        Peep how your captain's in it.<br />
        Feel good<br />
        Steady, watch me navigate.<br />
        Aha-ha-ha-ha-ha.<br />
        Feel good<br />
        <br />
        Don't stop, shit it, get it.<br />
        Peep how your captain's in it.<br />
        Feel good<br />
        Steady, watch me navigate.<br />
        Aha-ha-ha-ha-ha.<br />
        Feel good<br />
        <br />
        Shake it, shake it, shake it, feel good.<br />
        Shake it, shake it, shake it, feel good.<br />
        Shake it, shake it, shake it, feel good.<br />
        Shake it, shake it, shake it, feel good.
